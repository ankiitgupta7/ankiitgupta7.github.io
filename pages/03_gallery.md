I come from a remote village, called Tekuridih, in Jaunpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India. I moved to Calcutta during high school to better prepare for the IIT-JEE exam. The inspiration to go to IIT came from my elder brother, who graduated from IIT-BHU just as I entered IIT-KGP.

I enjoy playing outdoor sports, though the pandemic turned me into a mild chess addict. I am an average badminton player, a below-average tennis player, but a decent swimmer. Lately, I have even started showing some control in ping-pong.

I also enjoy writing poetry, mostly lingering somewhere between melancholy and hope (<a href="https://ankiitgupta7.github.io/" target="_blank">read here</a>). I love deep philosophical discussions about how human beings and the universe work and interact. Apart from a natural fondness for cricket, I have been a regular follower of tennis and badminton.

As for those who inspire me, I take inspiration from Sundar Pichai (Google CEO and fellow IIT-KGP alumnus), Abhijit Banerjee (Indian-American Nobel Laureate), and Rafael Nadalâ€”not just for their achievements, but for the journeys that shaped them.

Here are some pictures, that explain the above.
