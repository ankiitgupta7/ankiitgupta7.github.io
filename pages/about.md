Me at India Gate, New Delhi             |   My Affiliations until now!


I am a Final Year Engineering Undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">[IIT KGP]</a>, India.


I have been interested in Cognitive Sciences, Computational Cognitive Neurosciences, Evolutionary Psychology, Bio-inspired Robot Collectives and Cognitive Architectures, Cybernetics, & Intelligent System Design. The construct of consciousness in living beings and attempts to synthesize it in non-living beings fascinate me. Thus, I remain interested in both naturally existing (biological) as well as artificially intelligent systems. 

At the start of my third year, I opted for the “General Psychology” course at my university as one of the compulsory humanities courses as I now feel, I had some subliminal liking for this thing but never really got an opportunity to explore. So, I attended some more relevant courses available and all the passion to explore our own inner universe started from there. Later that year, I got an opportunity to work in a lab themed around consciousness as summer research intern. It had a deep impact on me, helping me to decide on pursuing research in the long run. I have restarted working with the PI of this lab very recently again and plan to continue remote collaboration until I start my PhDs.

I have been (remotely) part of a research group named [Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory](https://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/) at Champaign-Urbana, IL, USA, where my work was mainly based on simulating an artificial nervous system inspired from the book, *“Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology”* by cyberneticist *Valentino Braitenberg*. Working on this I developed deep interest in naturally exisiting intelligent systems and their origin. We wrote a paper on the same whose arXiv preprint can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07689). Also, we have been to [OHBM EquinoX Twitter conference 2020](https://twitter.com/OHBMequinoX/status/1241012923755102212) and [Artificial Life (ALife) Conference 2020](https://www.irit.fr/devonn/2020/07/13/alicea.html).

I have also worked on Agent-Based simulations exploring evolutionary origins of human reciprocity, at a research lab at **Harvard**. This was part of my attempt to explore fields of studies I am curious about. I absolutely love converting ideas into code and passionate to apply the same in areas I am interested in, so I have been exloring fields where I can be a good fit given my expertise and interest. I have used Agent-Based Simulations, Computation Modelling, & Various Experiment Design Paradigms in my work until now.

Presently, I am working on an open source project with **Red Hen Labs**, funded through the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**. The project summary can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/4650423719297024) at the official GSoC website.


I would be always looking for people to have a meaningful future collaboration, given my interests and abilities. Thanks for your time on my page.
