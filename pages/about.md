Me at India Gate, New Delhi             |   My Affiliations until now!


I am an MS student at the Graduate Institute of Mind, Brain, & Consciousness based in the capital city of Taiwan, Taipei. This is fully funded through Taiwan's Ministry of Education Scholarship as I am one of the 45 recipients of this prestigious scholarship. I completed my engineering undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), India in 2021.

I am essentially a passionate programmer interested in decoding the fundamentals of human cognition and natural intelligence. I have been involved in projects probing human unconscious perception, modeling human altruism, simulating an intelligent system mimicking naturally existing intelligent systems, and simulating primitive forms of communication in vervet monkeys to prove their better survival. These projects and more are associated with affiliations mentioned above.  

My most recent work was on an open source project with **Red Hen Labs**, funded through the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**. The project summary can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/4650423719297024) at the official GSoC website. For details of more project please look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tLMWNYgSdBTHX2qoYpzDAGhRV8pWJepd/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>CV</b></a>.


I would be always looking for people to have a meaningful future collaboration, given my interests and abilities. Thanks for your time on my page.
