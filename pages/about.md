Hello there! I am Ankit Gupta, PhD student (Fall'23 - present) of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, USA. I have been also part of MSU Dual PhD program in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB). In summers of 2024, I will be a visiting researcher at the Artificial Intelligence & Innovation Lab at Cedars-Sinai in West Hollywood, LA. 

I completed my undergraduate engineering degree in 2021 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), India, spending five most precious and memorable years of my life there. After this, I pursued a MS degree in Cognitive Neuroscience on full scholarship in Taipei City, graduating in May 2023. 

My primary research is focused on the synthesis and evolution of intelligent systems within digital environments,  guided by the insights from natural intelligence. I am deeply captivated by how evolution as an algorithm can lead to (emergent) complexity in both natural and artificially intelligent systems. These interests have prompted me to explore a spectrum of research domains, encompassing evolutionary computation, artificial life, digital evolution, emergence, intelligent systems, and complex systems. I leverage simulation and computational modeling to unravel the intricacies of these compelling fields. In short, my core interest lies in working  on evolving complex systems, centered around Neuroevolution and Open-endedness. I am also interested in automated Machine Learning (autoML) methods that are based on Evolutionary Computation.

My journey as a passionate programmer commenced during my junior high school days when I started programming in Java, and I continue to find joy in wielding code as a means to unravel the mysteries that interest me.

I am humbled and honored to have my research work published in the MIT Press Journal and Springer International Publishing. Also, I am thrilled about the prospects that lie ahead, as I have just embarked on my Ph.D. journey. I also recently presented my work at the International Conference on the Evolution of Language (Evolang XV) held in Madison, Wisconsin in May, 2024.
