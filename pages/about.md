-------------------------
My Advisors, Mentors, Supervisors, & Course Instructors   

I am an MS student working with [Prof. Philip Tseng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QNFVE3MAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Graduate Institute of Mind, Brain, & Consciousness based in the capital city of Taiwan, Taipei. This is fully funded through Taiwan's Ministry of Education Scholarship as I am one of the 45 recipients of this prestigious scholarship. I completed my engineering undergraduate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (**IIT-KGP**), India in 2021.

I am essentially a passionate programmer interested in decoding the fundamentals of human cognition and natural intelligence. I have been involved in projects probing human unconscious perception, modeling human altruism, simulating an intelligent system mimicking naturally existing intelligent systems, and simulating primitive forms of communication in vervet monkeys to prove their better survival. Given my diverse experience of working with natural and artificial systems, I have realised the key lies asking the 'why' questions so I am becoming inclined to look at everything through an evolutionary lens. These projects and more are associated with affiliations mentioned above.  

As part of my Master's degree in Cognitive Neuroscience, I have been working on experiments concerning unconscious human perception at *Brain & Cognition Lab* headed by my supervisor. Apart from this, I was very recently [accepted again](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/3gJf6UQy) to work on an open source project with [Red Hen Labs](https://www.redhenlab.org/), funded through the [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). So, this summer I would continue to build up on [work done last year](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/4650423719297024) apart from working on experiments concerning my Master's thesis. Very recently my first paper (earlier on arXiv) was [published](https://direct.mit.edu/artl/article-abstract/28/3/369/112444/Braitenberg-Vehicles-as-Developmental?redirectedFrom=fulltext) at Artificial Life, one of the MIT Press Journals. For details of more project please look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jjDeqModfTy9J--FCtU7Jh1vcm13BRZa/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>CV</b></a>.


I would be always looking for people to have a meaningful future collaboration, given my interests and abilities. **I am looking forward to start my doctoral degree in autumn 2023 as I will be finishing my current CogNeuroSci MS degree in summer 2023. So if you are looking for a prospective graduate student and find me to be a good match, please get in touch with me <a href="mailto: ankiitgupta7@gmail.com" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>**. Thanks for your time on my page.
