I am a Senior Year Engineering Undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur [IIT KGP], India.


I see myself as a budding enthusiast in Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures, Computational Cognitive Neurosciences, Bio-inspired Robot Collectives, Cybernetics, Intelligent Nervous Systems Design, & Behavioural Cognitive Psychology. The construct of consciousness in living beings and attempts to synthesize it in non-living beings fascinate me. Thus, I remain interested in both biologically as well as artificially intelligent systems.


I have used Agent-Based Simulations, Computation Modelling, & Various Experiment Design Paradigms in the works I have been associated with in the past. I am currently working on Developmental Neurosimulation using Braitentenberg Vehicles and Analysing EEG Data at one of our university lab.

A few semesters ago, I opted for the “General Psychology” course at my university as one of the compulsory humanities courses as I now feel, I had some subliminal liking for this thing but never really got an opportunity to explore. And it all started from there. I was overwhelmed as I went through the course since I felt it had the answer to all my curiosities since childhood. I took a few more courses available at my university relevant to this, namely “Psychology of Learning” and more importantly “Cognitive Information Processing”. And the latter made me more focused around the brain and neuroscience.

Since last year I have been working remotely with of a research group named [Orthogonal Research and Education Laboratory](https://orthogonal-research.weebly.com/) at Champaign-Urbana, IL USA. While working on this group, I have developed a deep interest in Cybernetics / Intelligent Nervous Systems. Here's the [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07689) to the ArXiv preprint of paper, we published recently.

Thanks for your time on my page.
