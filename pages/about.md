Me at India Gate, New Delhi             |   My Affiliations until now!


I am a batch of 2021 Engineering Graduate from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">[IIT KGP]</a>, India.

Out my many interternships during my univeristy days, one of the prominent experience involves working on Agent-Based software simulations exploring evolutionary origins of human reciprocity, at a research lab at **Harvard**. This was part of my attempt to explore fields of studies I am curious about. I absolutely love converting ideas into code and passionate to apply the same in areas I am interested in, so I have been exloring fields where I can be a good fit given my expertise and interest. I have used Software Development, Agent-Based Simulations, Computation Modelling, Data Analysis, & Various Experiment Design Paradigms in my work until now.

My most recent work was on an open source project with **Red Hen Labs**, funded through the **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**. The project summary can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/4650423719297024) at the official GSoC website.


I would be always looking for people to have a meaningful future collaboration, given my interests and abilities. Thanks for your time on my page.
