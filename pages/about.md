Me at India Gate, New Delhi             |   My Affiliations until now!



Hello there! I am Ankit Gupta, a recent graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), India, where I spent five precious and memorable years of my life completing my undergraduate engineering degree in 2021. I am happy to share that I will be starting my doctoral studies in Computer Science in the United States starting the fall of 2023. More details to follow soon.

As I embark on my doctoral studies, I will be continuing to work on my research interests that I have discovered till now. I am particularly interested in working on evolutionary computation, artificial life and digital evolution, emergence in complex systems using computational modeling and simulations.

I am honored to have had my research work recognized with the publication of my paper at MIT Press, and I am thrilled about the prospects that lie ahead as I am all set to start my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in the US. Thank you for your time on my page.
