Hello there! I am Ankit Gupta, first year PhD student of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, USA.

I completed my undergraduate engineering degree in 2021 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), India, spending five most precious and memorable years of my life there. After this, I pursued a MS degree in Cognitive Neuroscience on full scholarship in Taipei City, graduating in 2023. 

My research interests include evolutionary computation, artificial life, digital evolution, emergence, and complex systems. I mainly use simulation tools and computational modeling to work on my research interests. I have been a passionate programmer since my school days and I find it fun to use it study things that fascinate me.

I am humbled and honored to have my research work recognized with publications in the MIT Press Journal and Springer International Publishing. Also, I am thrilled about the prospects that lie ahead, as I have just embarked on my Ph.D. journey.
