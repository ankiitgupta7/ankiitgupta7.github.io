Me at India Gate, New Delhi             |   My Affiliations until now!



Hello there! I am Ankit Gupta, a recent graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-KGP), India, where I spent five precious and memorable years of my life completing my undergraduate engineering degree in 2021. I am happy to share that I will be starting my doctoral studies in Computer Science in the United States starting the fall of 2023. More details to follow soon.

Speaking of evolution of my research interest, during my third year of undergraduate studies at IIT-KGP, I discovered Valentino Braitenberg's book, Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology, while applying for an international open-source program known as Google Summer of Code. Inspired by Braitenberg's concept that synthesis is simpler than analysis, I created an agent-based simulation platform with multi-agent systems that resulted in some remarkable emergent behaviors from simple rules. This project allowed me to bring the figments of the thought experiment into a digital reality. Although I was not accepted into the program, I developed a swarm/collective intelligent system through an existing approach called agent-based modeling. My project mentor was impressed with my simulations, and we co-wrote a paper titled "Braitenberg Vehicles as Developmental Neurosimulation" (2022), which was published in the Artificial Life Journal at MIT Press. This work establishes a foundation for studying the evolution of nervous systems from scratch in a digital environment, and I am excited to build upon it in the future by integrating Karl Sims' ideas to monitor the development of both neuronal networks and phenotypes as they evolve.

In the summer following my senior year, I worked on an agent-based modeling project with Prof. Max Krasnow at Harvard University. Our goal was to determine why altruism, as a behavior, is selected through generations of evolution. After familiarizing myself with the existing codebase, I primarily assisted in developing an improved version that introduced additional genes leading to one of the multiple forms of cooperative or defective strategies in the agent interaction. This project exposed me to modeling natural selection on agents using evolutionary game theory, which was my first experience in modeling evolution. Furthermore, it showed me the numerous ‘why’ questions that can be addressed through agent-based modeling.

Upon completing my engineering degree in the summer of 2021, I was accepted into the Google Summer of Code, which I continued working on during the summer of 2022. This agent-based modeling project involves modeling and simulating representational communication in vervet monkeys over the past two summers with Prof. Francis Steen at UCLA. We intend to examine evidence from the simulation data to look for survival benefits resulting from this communication, thus shedding light on the earliest documented mode of communication between species that may offer clues for language evolution. I have developed simulation software and created a pure computational version in Python, which runs on HPC to collect simulation data quickly, as we are dealing with multi-generational data.

As I embark on my doctoral studies, I will be continuing to work on my research interests that I have discovered till now. I am particularly interested in working on evolutionary computation, artificial life and digital evolution, emergence in complex systems using computational modeling and simulations.

I am honored to have had my research work recognized with the publication of my paper at MIT Press, and I am thrilled about the prospects that lie ahead as I am all set to start my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering in the US. Thank you for your time on my page.
