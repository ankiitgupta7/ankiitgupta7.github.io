    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p>
      I am Ankit Gupta, a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University" target="_blank">
        Michigan State University (MSU)
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before joining MSU, I earned my undergraduate <i>engineering</i> degree in 2021 at the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Kharagpur" target="_blank">
        Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (<i>IIT-KGP</i>)
      </a>,
      spending five of the most precious and memorable years of my life there.
      I then pursued an MS in <i>Cognitive Neuroscience</i> on a <i>full scholarship</i> in Taipei City,
      graduating in May 2023.

I come from a remote village, called Tekuridih, in Jaunpur district, Uttar Pradesh, India. I moved to Calcutta during high school to better prepare for the IIT-JEE exam. The inspiration to go to IIT came from my elder brother, who graduated from IIT-BHU just as I entered IIT-KGP.

I enjoy playing outdoor sports, though the pandemic turned me into a mild chess addict. I am an average badminton player, a below-average tennis player, but a decent swimmer. Lately, I have even started showing some control in ping-pong.

I also enjoy writing poetry, mostly lingering somewhere between melancholy and hope (<a href="https://ankiitgupta7.github.io/" target="_blank">read here</a>). I love deep philosophical discussions about how human beings and the universe work and interact. Apart from a natural fondness for cricket, I have been a regular follower of tennis and badminton.

As for those who inspire me, I take inspiration from Sundar Pichai (Google CEO and fellow IIT-KGP alumnus), Abhijit Banerjee (Indian-American Nobel Laureate), and Rafael Nadal—not just for their achievements, but for the journeys that shaped them.

Here are some pictures, that explain the above.
