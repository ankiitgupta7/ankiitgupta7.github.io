I am from a remote village, named Tekuridih, in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh in India. And then moved to Calcutta during my high school to prepare better for the IIT-JEE exam. The inspiration to go to IIT came from my elder brother who graduated from IIT-BHU when I entered IIT-KGP.

I like to play outdoor sports though the pandemic turned me into a mild chess addict. I am a below average player of Badminton, Tennis but a relatively better swimmer. Recently, I have started showing control in Ping-Pong too. Sometime I think if overthinking were a sport, Iâ€™d definitely be a pro there. 

I also enjoy writing poetry, mostly lingering somewhere between melancholy and hope. I love deep philosophical discussions on anything related to how human beings and the universe work and interact. Apart from natutal fondness for Cricket, I have been a regular follower of Tennis and Badminton. And talking about my idols, I take inspiration from Sundar Pichai [Google CEO / IIT KGP Alumni], Abhijit Banerjee [Indian-American Nobel Laureate] and Rafael Nadal [Tennis Player], given their background.

Here are some pictures, that explain the above.
