My curiousity has lead me to explore many questions / concepts / phenomenon that I find fascinating. I am documenting few of them below. I will also list some of sources where you find this kind of content.

* *Consciousness*: What makes us conscious and what constitutes consciouness?
* *Intelligence and Emotion*: Are these mere manifestation of a set of rules?
* *Evolution of Human Cognition, Perception, and Behaviour*: What are their building blocks from an evolutionary viewpoint?
* *Perception of Reality and Extrasensory Perception*: Do you know reality is often different than what you experience with your senses? What about the experinces without any sensory stimultion?
* *Cellular Automata*: Is the universe a 3D Cellular Automata, whose rules nobody knows? You may look for 'Game of Life' by *John Conway* and *Stephen Wolfram's* models in his 2002 publication 'A New Kind of Science' to find content to ponder on this.
* *Intelligence (Bio-inspired) in Nature and Swarm Intelligence*
    * Bird Flocking (Boids) Algorithm by *Craig Reynolds*
    * Slime Moulds
    * Ant Colonies
* *What leads to a life form*: The Miller-Urey Experiment
* *Are we living in a simulation?*: Can you disprove it?
* *Virtual Organisms*: E. Coli simulation by OpenWorm Foundation
