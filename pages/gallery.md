I come from rural India, born and brought up in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh. And then moved to Calcutta during my high school to prepare better for the IIT-JEE exam. For me, libraries are the favourite places to be, while being anywhere in the world. Solo evenings at beaches/riverbanks are also desirable. Once forced into cooking in some dire circumstances, I have learned to make some of usual Indian food with minimal raw material supply.

I am a below average player of Badminton, Tennis but a relatively better swimmer. I've been always a passionate writer, usually writing blogs on variety of topics but recently more inclined to poetry after writing my first poetry piece. I love deep philosophical discussions on anything related to how human beings and the universe work and interact. I am a regular follower of Tennis, Badminton and Cricket. And talking about my idols, I take inspiration from Sundar Pichai [Google CEO / IIT KGP Alumni], Abhijit Banerjee [Indian-American Nobel Laureate] and Rafael Nadal [Tennis Player], given their background.

Here are some pictures, that explain the above.
