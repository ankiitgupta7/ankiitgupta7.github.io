## Abstract
We present a framework for meta-brain models, or hybrid models that capture multiple aspects of developmental neuro- biology and behavior. A developmentally-inspired embodied learning agent architecture is combined with a contextually- explicit representational layer to form a complex artificial nervous system. The architectural description is summarized in terms of morphological differentiation, context-handling, and generalized architectural features. In conclusion, we pro- pose potential functional milestones that help further expli- cate the usefulness of our approach.
