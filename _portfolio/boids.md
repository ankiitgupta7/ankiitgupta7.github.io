According to Wikipedia, Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. His paper on this topic was published in 1987 in the proceedings of the ACM SIGGRAPH conference. The name "boid" corresponds to a shortened version of "bird-oid object", which refers to a bird-like object. Incidentally, "boid" is also a New York Metropolitan dialect pronunciation for "bird".

*The code for this simulation is taken from one of the open source projects from p5.js with an aim to further customize and develop the existing simulation. The link at the top takes you to the already developed or the simulation under development.*
