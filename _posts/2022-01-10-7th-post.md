*This came off as sudden urge to write when I was listening to the compositions from the movie 'La La Land' on a post-Monday midnight during my first corporate job. So thought of what would I talk about and ask if I could talk to the City of Stars, Mumbai!*

City of stars, why you’ve brought me to you,

City of Stars, what do you want me to accrue?

\
Who knows, where’ll I end after being here,

Will I do wonders or remain just an employee?

\
City of stars, why are you not letting me breathe free,

City of stars, when'll I stop hearing decree?

\
Will I be able to find peace or accept this reality,

Or at least find a way to deal with people’s duality.

\
I hope when I leave, I don’t feel the grieve, that I’d to come here,

In a situation so tense, with debts immense, that my dreams seemed smeared.

\
City of stars, will you give me this chance?

Let me fly away, giving my recent affairs a glance!

\
City of stars, I want to pursue my dreams,

City of stars, I want back my rightfully earned esteem!

\
City of stars, can you do this for me?
