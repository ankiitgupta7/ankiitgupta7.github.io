*This is another poem that I wrote living in a renthouse in Calcutta after my univeristy forcefully vacated the campus. As I come from a remote village in Uttar Pradesh, India, I had no option but to lend some money from friends and rent a house in a city to ensure a decent internet connection and electicity. This exposed the equality in resources that all students had while on campus. And I have no idea how have some people managed the situation who come from even worse background than me.*

*This poem is dedicated all who have suffered / are suffering due to the sheer ignorance of university administrations and maybe a last cry to let people feel our pain!*

*This peice has been recently got published from a medium page called Millennial Poets.*
