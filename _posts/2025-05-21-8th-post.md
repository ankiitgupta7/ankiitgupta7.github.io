*I have been a fan of "Touchstone" and sometime identify myself as the "fool and melacholic" character from Shakespeare's "As You Like It". Even though things have been merrier off late, I can't help but sometime fall into and enjoy melancholy as a mood (I also have a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4FDpsjQAn1BWETaU0qcwF4?si=06aac57490aa4b82) named "Enjoying Depression" in  my defence). Here's some melancholic thoughts I scribbled on some rainy evening in Michigan.*

What is there in sadness that happiness can’t trigger,

Why does it hit harder than any emotion, however stronger?

\
What is there in melancholy that you sometimes crave,

Why do you want to cry, even when you seem so brave?

\
What makes it remind you of things you didn’t realize otherwise,

Why does it suddenly make you feel guilty, with no choice but to despise?

\
Is it another of nature’s tricks to help you prevail,

Or just an emotion that keeps you humane and frail?

\
Is it something that mankind is prone to — a fundamental human behavior,

Or just a channel to flush out the exhaustion from the façade of feigned valor?

\
Is it always related to a loved one or your lover,

And if it is just a mirror to make you look back, reflect, and ponder?

\
Regardless of our understanding of the truth that leads to melancholy,

It will keep spawning generations of Tagores, Shakespeares, and Walter Raleighs!
