*This is a tale describing experiences of my 5 years at IIT-KGP. I was tempted to tell my story too as I experienced goosebumbs while watching the recently released Netflix Documentary on IIT, "[Alma Matters](https://www.netflix.com/title/81368109)". As we are graduating with heavy hearts amidst this pandemic, I believe any average KGPian will relate to it.*

You would have found me always whining,

Ranting my frustrations about my department, that is, Mining.

\
I tried all my first semester for a department change,

But ending up with my SG well below the desired range.

\
Now as all hopes were gone with my CG around seven,

I couldn't think of but only hope for a ten on ten.

\
But as the second semester proceeded gradually,

I could sense my eventual fate actually.

\
With post-result roll number changes on the Facebook walls,

I could barely face people next semester in my hall.

\
I felt I was simply not worth such ostentations,

With no society or friends to soak in my depression.

\
My brother, an ex-IITian told me to keep on coding,

So I conformed, hoping that might help me get rid of self-loathing.

\
But then a strange thing happened at the start of my third year,

Ended up choosing a course that didn’t seem like I had to bear.

\
While I was still insignificant to my peers,

I kept on bearing people’s jeers.

\
I audited another course that was being offered,

And kept it to myself to avoid being mockered.

\
Such was the pressure to earn an identity,

But I kept doing what I liked leading to my serenity.

\
And all this lead to a research intern abroad,

So now I could also flaunt my “perfect life” facade.

\
As love reacts from strangers bolstered some ego,

I couldn’t help but keep posting till I had to go.

\
But then I contemplated on what I had become,

Realizing answers to the society should be through outcome.

\
After coming back to KGP post third year summers,

I explored more opportunities converting some to offers.

\
And then while I was working on my third research intern,

We were thrown out of campus, never to return.

\
I wrote so many emails to authorities regarding my concerns,

But no one listened or felt my yearn.

\
I somehow survived the last few semesters online,

But then watching “Alma Matters” a few days ago, I realized this story is not only mine.

\
This is how my friends, the five years have been in my KGP life,

I hope my juniors will take lessons from it, not falling prey to options that are rife.
